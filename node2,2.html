In the run-up to Creator-fest there is a flurry of activity on CReel. As an exclusive physical event, it is a golden ticket for those wishing to build or strengthen their social network, and raise their prestige. You continue to slave away at the quip factory for your family, all-the-while fleshing out your own authentic virtual Identity.<br><br>
You begin to feel like the next quip you have to write will be the death of you, but before your fingers have touched the keyboard you receive a notification on your CReel. How? It can’t be. It reads: "I am a CReel moderator. You speak from the heart and CReel needs more of that. That said, we do not give to those who have not proven themselves, I will validate your ID for 24 hours, you can become one of us... if you survive! Materials will be provided in due course."<br><br>
Your host family, engrossed in their newfound fame, do not notice the package that has arrived for you. You take it to your cupboard of a room. Inside there are clothes, a pill and a note. You unfold the note, there is only one line: "Swallow the tracker to begin the hunt." Without thinking, you swallow the pill, slip into the clothes and head for the street, grabbing a bottle of something from the fridge.<br><br>
The cold is overwhelming, the streets look empty but you feel as if there are eyes watching from every corner. A shriek pierces through the night and you break into a run. You’re not sure where you are going but you are sure it knows. You’re being stalked to a destination of its making. You never have been in control and you never will. They know everything about you, you gave it to them willingly.<br><br>
You shake your head and try to focus, exhausted and thirsty you retrieve the bottle from your bag, it smells terrible.<br><br>
