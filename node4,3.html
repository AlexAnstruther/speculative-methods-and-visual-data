What a disaster! You can still hear the aftershocks of your “accident”, echoing through the empty streets, luckily no one is around to make a fool of you, and to be honest, who cares? You can’t help but laugh at the absurdity of it all. Maybe the Creator has a similar sense of humour. As you make the long journey home you contemplate whether anybody would believe your story or chalk it up to attention seeking. “It’s true. Sometimes reality is stranger than fiction” you think to yourself.<br><br>
Upon arriving home and dealing with the fallout, you see yet another notification on your CReel. “It never ends!” you think.<br><br>

“Dear CineReeler,<br>
I had a blast meeting you today and found your company most refreshing. I hope to see more of you at future events and can assure you are most welcome among the creators.<br>
Yours, a new friend<br>
P.S. Your parting gift reminded me of the impact the real world has on people, and brought some levity and a much needed reality check. If you’ll check the latest patch notes I thought we could share this with everyone.”<br><br>

Scouring the latest Network patch notes, as instructed, you find the the line in question:<br>
“• Added involuntary flatulence to users avatar, when a user garners a significant number of likes”<br><br>
A grin spreads across your face as you anticipate your family spending a little less time caught up in their virtual world, and the opportunity to connect with like minded individuals among the creators. Maybe you can have the best of both worlds?<br><br>
You reflect on the path that has brought you here and what is important to you, you consider how your choices led you to this point and realise your lack of control brought this about, you had some power but sometimes you're caught in an alleyway with your pants down, and that’s ok.<br><br>
The End<br><br>
