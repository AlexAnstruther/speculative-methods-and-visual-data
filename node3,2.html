Out of breath and scared half-to-death you arrive at Cine-fest. You are unable to forget the three shrieks that marked your journey. There is a stabbing pain in your stomach as you reach the queue. You find yourself unable to regain composure. Everything is unfamiliar, the netizens talk funny obsessively using acronyms, and despite being more physically accustomed the creators presence intimidates you. You wipe the sweat from your brow, your heart racing and head for the entrance. The guard, clad in a sleek uniform, eyes you with suspicion.<br><br>
"Your pass". He states expectantly<br><br>
Fumbling, you reach your arm out. The scanner hums, and for a moment, everything seems to stand still.<br><br>
The guard grunts and waves you through, you hurriedly step by not wishing to give him an opportunity to change his mind. You could have sworn you heard him mention a target under his breath. You move on, there’s no time you need to be present and authentic, they can’t sense your fear and doubt.<br><br>
You find yourself in conversation with a netizen, he can’t understand why you would want the network to be more “real” and it becomes heated. You step backwards tripping as you go and a Creator catches you. Regaining your balance you try to pull away but he holds your wrist tight. “You think that was what we wanted from you” he sneers “Your time is up, now go, you’re responsible for more than just your own fate tonight ”. You glimpse a clock, it's 11:55, ripping your arm away, you turn and run. Responsible for who? Your host family? They’re dependent on you but they aren’t your responsibility.<br><br>
