In the run-up to Creator-fest there is a flurry of activity on CReel. As an exclusive physical event, it is a golden ticket for those wishing to build or strengthen their social network, and raise their prestige. You continue to slave away at the quip factory for your host family, all-the-while fleshing out your own authentic virtual Identity.<br><br>
Then, as if by magic, you receive a notification on your CReel: "I am a CReel moderator. You speak from the heart and CReel needs more of that. I cannot give you an official ticket for Creator-fest, but I will validate your ID for 24 hours, you can become one of them. Use it well. Materials will be provided in due course."<br><br>
It is the night of Creator-fest. Your host family, brimming with excitement, hardly knows what to do with themselves. Your work has paid off, all three women have received tickets thanks to your quips. You don’t know whether to feel proud or dismayed. The mother wears an extravagant, if somewhat fusty, gown and the sisters wear basic and revealing shirts & skirts. All three seem to have forgotten how you were instructed to portray them on CReel. “Use The Network all you like tonight, some of us have real lives to live” with that parting jibe, they leave. You are alone with just your thoughts… and a package.<br><br>
Inside are clothes, a band and a note. The clothes are practical yet expressive, styled from your heritage. “That makes a change from your jumpsuit”, you think to yourself. You slip the band on your wrist and unfold the note, there is only one word: “Roof”. You make your way to the fire-escape and ascend, two steps at a time. A transport pod awaits you, a device normally reserved for Creators. You take a moment to marvel at the design and step inside.<br><br>
