It doesn’t feel real as you glide through the LDN night, a kaleidoscopic view of the city’s lights reflecting off the sleek surfaces of your transport pod. For the first time in your life, the algorithms are serving you, taking you where you want to go.<br><br>
You step out from the transport pod and join the red carpet queue. To your surprise, everyone seems friendly and authentic, not how you had imagined them from your time on The Network. That said, there is still a clear difference between the creators and the netizens in their behaviour. As you approach the entrance your heart races. “Your pass, please” asks the guard. Fumbling slightly, you reach your arm out. The scanner hums, and for a moment, everything seems to stand still. "You're all set," the guard says, the scanner beeping in approval. "Enjoy the fest!" You nod, your anxiety melting into relief and excitement. "Thank you," you reply, stepping through the gateway.<br><br>
You find yourself in conversation with a netizen trying to explain your fondness for the physical world. Overwhelmed by his peculiar body language and strange use of language, you look for support around you. A nearby creator observes your discussion with amusement whisking you away. “So you're not a fan of the network?” the creator comments, a curious smile on his face. “I am. It’s a miraculous thing, but there is a reason why we are physically present tonight, is there not?” you respond. “There is a reason why we are here,” he responds “but why are you here? You are clearly not a netizen and nor are you a Creator. Who are you?” His tone is warm, inviting you to share your story. You feel compelled to do so. As you tell your story you become more confident, you have a voice, your own voice. The creator inquires about your plans after the fest and you notice, in shock, that it is almost midnight. Forgetting yourself you turn to run, your ID band slipping from your wrist as you do so.<br><br>
