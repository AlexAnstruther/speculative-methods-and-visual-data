Out of breath and scared half-to-death you arrive at Cine-fest. You are unable to forget the three shrieks that marked your journey. There is a stabbing pain in your stomach as you reach the queue. You find yourself unable to regain composure. Everything is unfamiliar, the netizens obsessively use acronyms, and despite being more physically accustomed the creators presence intimidates you. You wipe the sweat from your brow, your heart racing and head for the entrance. The guard, clad in a sleek uniform, eyes you with suspicion.<br><br>
Your stomach growls as you approach and the guard’s face softens. "Hungry?" he grins "You're in for a treat the Creators know real food." You look at him blankly. Disappointed, he asks for your pass. He scans it and furrows his brow “I think we have problem, don’t you?” You freeze in terror. “Relax” he guffaws and pats you on the shoulder “In you go, get some real food in your belly. That sludge you get at home makes you hungry.” He winks and nudges you through.<br><br>
Still dazed, you push past him and enter the fest. To commemorate media throughout history they have actors in the crows recreating iconic characters. You find yourself stuck in a thrupple with a netizen who you can’t make sense of and a near mute man with exaggerated facial expressions. “This  Mr. Bean.!” the netizen exclaims with a little dance. Desperate to be talking to anybody else you scan the room wildly.<br><br>
You catch eyes with a creator and separate yourself from your current companions to meet him, “He knows” you think to yourself, your paranoia and funny tummy distract you from where you’re going. You slip on food “Bean” has dropped tumbling through the air. The creator catches you by the arm a beep is emitted by his band. He confirms it was him who had set this up, and that you had nothing to fear the test wasn’t real, the pill was a placebo and you showed courage and stayed true to what you believed was right in attending. Relieved you still find yourself unable to focus due to growing pressure in your stomach, a thin wisp of gas escapes you and you rush out the exit.<br><br>
