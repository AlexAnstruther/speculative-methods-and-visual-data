Racing against the ticking clock, you flee the fest, heart pounding with a mix of adrenaline and fear. “Are you safe, did you pass, what else do you have to do?” You retrace your steps home, there is no longer anyone out there watching but now you find your own way home in this empty labyrinth.<br><br>
Before long you find yourself at the location of the third and final shriek. To your horror you realise where it came from: your host mother, her mangled body lies on the road in front of you. Your heart sinks, you understand now, desperate to get home in time to your father you run blindly through the night.<br><br>
The journey home was arduous, your only reference points being the bodies of your host sisters. You are exhausted, terrified for your father, but there is a cold relief in that your host family can no longer hold you back. You bolt up the five flights of stairs to your unit and burst through the door.<br><br>
A figure is hunched over obscured from view, you pray that it is your father and that he has not met the same fate as the rest.  “Father?”. The figure turns to you and steps aside simultaneously revealing his identity and your father’s body. Tears roll down your face as you see his vacant eyes. The figure, who you can clearly see is the Creator from the festival speaks: “Congratulations, you pass, we see that you have what you need to join us, you shown your weakness every step of the way, you chose this path we simply guided you. You have one final choice now, will you leave the past behind or will you stay and join them.”<br><br>
You reflect on the path that has brought you here and what is important to you, you consider how your choices led you to this point and realise that your despair made this inevitable, you had little power in the matter, but maybe the choice you make now can make a difference. You do not know what to do...<br><br>
The End<br><br>
