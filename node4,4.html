Your mind races, was that a disaster? Did you make a fool of yourself? Maybe he didn’t notice…<br><br>
Upon arriving home you’re surprised to find that your host family is already back, with none other than the Creator in tow! “Smells like roses” your host mother jests, but this time her tone lacks the usual bite. Your host sisters smile with a similar genuine friendliness. “I found these charming ladies at the festival after your hasty exit” The Creator states with a wry grin. “They had a lot to say, but were quite taken aback by my tales of CineReeler’s exploits.”<br><br>
The creator steps closer, their presence is commanding yet kind. “What you have achieved is remarkable and I’d like to offer you a place among the Creators, to shape the network and truly have a platform to share your stories…” he says “...but beyond that I was hoping that you may share more of your stories with me, perhaps over dinner?”<br><br>
Your host family squeals with delight at the prospect of someone they know joining the Creators and your Father sits stunned. <br><br>
You reflect on the path that has brought you here and what is important to you, you consider how your choices led you to this point and realise you made this happen, your decisions have led you to a position where there is no longer any thinking left to do, the choice is obvious.<br><br>
The End<br><br>
